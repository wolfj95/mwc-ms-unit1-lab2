# Making with Code Middle School - Unit 1 Lab
This repo contains a prototype of a webiste for the Making with Code Middle
School project. Each page of the website breaks a lab down into small chunks, each covering
a single task students need to complete and embeds a basic Python IDE into
each  page where students can complete the task.
